Module 9 Challenge

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company).
Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database,
and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Instructions
Challenge divided in three parts: data modeling, data engineering and data analysis.
All files will be saved in the folder EmployeeSQL.
Data modeling included in file DataModeling_Ch9.png created using QuickDBD.
Data engineering included in file schemaChallenge.sql using pgAdmin4 ver 15.
Data analysis included in file QuerySQLChallenge.sql using pgAdmin4 ver 15.
Six tables included as csv files in the folder data.
